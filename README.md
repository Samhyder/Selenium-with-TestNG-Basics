# Selenium-with-TestNG-Basics

This repo is useful for learning the basics of TestNG and how it integrates with Selenium webdriver in a java project.

TestNG is useful for creating reports, as WebDriver cannot generate reports on its own.

Annotations are used with methods for executing Test Cases.

#Few Points: 
//One @Test annotation represents one test case.

//It must be rememebered that if there are more than one test case with @Test annotation, then execution will happen in alphabetical order of the method names.

//There are other ways like setting priorities which will overcome the issue of order of execution.

//TestNG reports will be present in test-output folder. 

//In test-output folder, there are three files emailable-report.html, index-html, Default Suite/Defaul Test.html which are considered as reports for testCases executed.
